/*you can also not download visual studio as it is not too important.You just have to see a tutorial to set up cpp from
vs code and then you can use "g++ <name of file> (dont use these pointed brackets with file name) and then a a.exe or a.out
file will be created . Then you can run it by either typing a.exe for .exe file and ./a.out for .out file
